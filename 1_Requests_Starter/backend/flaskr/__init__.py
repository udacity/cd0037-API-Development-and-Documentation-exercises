# @TODO: General Instructions
#   - As you're creating endpoints, define them and then search for 'TODO' within the frontend to update the endpoints there. 
#     If you do not update the endpoints, the lab will not work - of no fault of your API code! 
#   - Make sure for each route that you're thinking through when to abort and with which kind of error 
#   - If you change any of the response body keys, make sure you update the frontend to correspond.

  # @TODO: Write a route that retrivies all books, paginated. 
  #         You can use the constant above to paginate by eight books.
  #         If you decide to change the number of books per page,
  #         update the frontend to handle additional books in the styling and pagination

  # TEST: When completed, the webpage will display books including title, author, and rating shown as stars


  

  # @TODO: Write a route that will update a single book's rating. 
  #         It should only be able to update the rating, not the entire representation
  #         and should follow API design principles regarding method and route.  
  #         Response body keys: 'success'
  # TEST: When completed, you will be able to click on stars to update a book's rating and it will persist after refresh


  # @TODO: Write a route that will delete a single book. 
  #        Response body keys: 'success', 'deleted'(id of deleted book), 'books' and 'total_books'
  #        Response body keys: 'success', 'books' and 'total_books'

  # TEST: When completed, you will be able to delete a single book by clicking on the trashcan.


  # @TODO: Write a route that create a new book. 
  #        Response body keys: 'success', 'created'(id of created book), 'books' and 'total_books'
  # TEST: When completed, you will be able to a new book using the form. Try doing so from the last page of books. 
  #       Your new book should show up immediately after you submit it at the end of the page.
